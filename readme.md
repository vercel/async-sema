# async-sema

This is a semaphore implementation for use with `async` and `await`. The implementation
follows the traditional definition of a semaphore rather than the definition of
an asynchronous semaphore. Where as the latter one generally allows every
defined task to proceed immediately and synchronizes at the end, async-sema
allows only a selected number of tasks to proceed at once while the rest will
remain waiting.

Async-sema manages the semaphore count as a list of tokens instead of a single
variable containing the number of available resources. This enables an
interesting application of managing the actual resources with the semaphore
object itself. To make it practical the constructor for Sema includes an option
for providing an init function for the semaphore tokens. Use of a custom token
initializer is demonstrated in `example1.js`.

## Usage

Firstly, add the package to your project's `dependencies`:

```bash
npm install --save async-sema
```

Then start using it like shown [here](./examples).

## Example
See [/examples](./examples) for more use cases.

```js
const Sema = require('async-sema');
const s = new Sema(
  4, // Allow 4 concurrent async calls
  {
    capacity: 100 // Prealloc space for 100 tokens
  }
);

async function fetchData(x) {
  await s.acquire()
  try {
    console.log(s.nrWaiting() + ' calls to fetch are waiting')
    // ... do some async stuff with x
  } finally {
    s.release();
  }
}

const data = await Promise.all(array.map(fetchData));
```

The package also offers a simple rate limiter utilizing the semaphore
implementation.

```js
const RateLimit = require('async-sema/rate-limit');

async function f() {
  const lim = RateLimit(5); // rps

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    await lim();
    // ... do something async
  }
}
```

## API

### Constructor(nr, { initFn, pauseFn, resumeFn, capacity })

- `nr` The maximum number of callers allowed to acquire the semaphore
  concurrently.
- `initFn` Function that is used to initialize the tokens used to manage
  the semaphore. The default is `() => '1'`.
- `pauseFn` An optional fuction that is called to opportunistically request
  pausing the the incoming stream of data, instead of piling up waiting
  promises and possibly running out of memory.
  See [examples/pausing.js](./examples/pausing.js).
- `resumeFn` An optional function that is called when there is room again
  to accept new waiters on the semaphore. This function must be declared
  if a `pauseFn` is declared.
- `capacity` Sets the size of the preallocated waiting list inside the
  semaphore. This is typically used by high performance where the developer
  can make a rough estimate of the number of concurrent users of a semaphore.

### async drain()

Drains the semaphore and returns all the initialized tokens in an array.
Draining is an ideal way to ensure there are no pending async tasks, for
example before a process will terminate.

### nrWaiting()

Returns the number of callers waiting on the semaphore, i.e. the number of
pending promises.

### async acquire()

Acquire a token from the semaphore, thus decrement the number of available
execution slots. If `initFn` is not used then the return value of the function
can be discarded.

### release(token)

Release the semaphore, thus increment the number of free execution slots. If
`initFn` is used then the `token` returned by `acquire()` should be given as
an argument when calling this function.
